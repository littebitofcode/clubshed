# A summer project.

The objective is to create an automated solution to maintain the water level in a garden pond.

It's a small pond, a few square meters, but in summer especially, suffers from evaporation, and needs topping up around once a week.
It would be nice to automate this, and also to see if we can use rainwater as much as possible, as opposed to water directly from the main.

Other requirements might be such things as:
- Use of solar power if and where possible
- Logging sensor outputs, and producing graphs
- Some HomeAssistant integration
-

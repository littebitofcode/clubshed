For DIY home automation, HomeAssistant is indeed a fantastic option: functional, well-supported, and highly extensible. However, as a coder, I occasionally encounter frustrations, especially during debugging or when integrating extensions. To address this, I've conceived a straightforward standalone wrapper. 

This wrapper encapsulates my customizations, automations, and extensions, allowing for easy upgrades and replacements of the core HomeAssistant while enabling me to develop using a modular, testable approach.

The wrapper serves as a sandbox for experimentation, providing a controlled environment for testing new features without risking the stability of the main HomeAssistant setup. Additionally, it promotes code reusability and maintainability by encapsulating functionality into distinct modules, making it easier to manage and scale as the automation ecosystem evolves.

Home 3D printing has become increasingly accessible and enjoyable. A plethora of software options cater to different design and printing stages, each with its own following and advantages. 

Personally, I favor OpenSCAD for its simplicity and accessibility, given my coding background. 

However, it does have limitations, particularly in applying features like chamfers and fillets, which I address by exporting to FreeCAD and applying there.

This prompts the idea of consolidating these tools into a unified pseudo application or workbench, integrating the slicer for a seamless workflow.
